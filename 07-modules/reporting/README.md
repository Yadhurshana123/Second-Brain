# Reporting Module Overview

## Module Purpose
The `reporting` module groups related Unified Commerce capabilities and documents how they are implemented across database, backend, API, frontend, security, and cache/storage layers.
All tenant-operational capabilities in this module must support tenant-specific configuration through feature entitlements, role permissions, role-feature assignment, and runtime feature flags.

## Feature Folders
| Feature | Spec | API | History |
|---|---|---|---|
| `daily-discount-return-reporting` | [[features/daily-discount-return-reporting/feature-spec|Spec]] | [[features/daily-discount-return-reporting/api-spec|API]] | [[features/daily-discount-return-reporting/feature-history|History]] |
| `daily-inventory-reporting` | [[features/daily-inventory-reporting/feature-spec|Spec]] | [[features/daily-inventory-reporting/api-spec|API]] | [[features/daily-inventory-reporting/feature-history|History]] |
| `daily-payment-reporting` | [[features/daily-payment-reporting/feature-spec|Spec]] | [[features/daily-payment-reporting/api-spec|API]] | [[features/daily-payment-reporting/feature-history|History]] |
| `daily-sales-reporting` | [[features/daily-sales-reporting/feature-spec|Spec]] | [[features/daily-sales-reporting/api-spec|API]] | [[features/daily-sales-reporting/feature-history|History]] |

## Database Tables Commonly Used
| Table | Purpose in module |
|---|---|
| `daily_sales_summaries` | Supports `reporting` module workflows and tenant-scoped persistence. |
| `daily_payment_summaries` | Supports `reporting` module workflows and tenant-scoped persistence. |
| `daily_inventory_summaries` | Supports `reporting` module workflows and tenant-scoped persistence. |
| `daily_discount_return_summaries` | Supports `reporting` module workflows and tenant-scoped persistence. |
| `audit_logs` | Supports `reporting` module workflows and tenant-scoped persistence. |

## Access Control Position
- Platform-admin-only configuration remains platform-controlled.
- Tenant-facing features must be configurable for each customer tenant.
- Feature availability starts with `platform_features` and `tenant_feature_entitlements`.
- Tenant admins configure roles, role permissions, and role-feature access where allowed.
- Backend checks cannot be replaced by menu hiding or disabled buttons.

```

## Backend Placement
| Layer | Folder | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| API | `POS.API/Modules/Reporting` | Controllers, request models, response models. |
| Application | `POS.Application/Modules/Reporting` | Services, validators, interfaces, and `Dtos/`. |
| Domain | `POS.Domain/Modules/Reporting` | Pure rules and entities where needed. |
| Infrastructure | `POS.Infrastructure/Repositories/Reporting` | EF Core repositories and persistence logic. |

## Frontend Placement
- Feature UI belongs under `src/features/` using React with TypeScript.
- Page composition belongs under `src/pages/` and layout shell folders.
- Server state uses TanStack Query from `core/api/queryClient.ts`.
- Workflow state uses Zustand stores from `src/state/`.
- Offline POS storage uses `core/offline/syncQueue.ts` and IndexedDB.

## Caching and Storage Placement
| Layer | Placement | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Backend PostgreSQL | Reporting read models and indexed audit queries | Use `daily_*_summaries` where available; no Redis now. |
| Frontend TanStack Query | Report result pages, audit log pages, dashboards | Cache by tenant, scope, date range, permission context, and filters. |
| Zustand | Current filter panel state and selected report view | Keep only UI state. |
| IndexedDB | Not default | Only offline sync diagnostics on POS terminals should persist locally. |

## Implementation Considerations
- Do not add new tables unless approved by database design or a formal schema change.
- Do not create generic cache tables such as tenant cache, product cache, POS cache, or query cache.
- Use PostgreSQL indexes, deterministic queries, and existing read models for repeated backend reads.
- Use invalidation rather than stale UI assumptions after create/update/delete/approval actions.
- Keep tenant boundaries visible in API, repository queries, tests, and audit logs.
